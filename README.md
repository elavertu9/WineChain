<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
WineChain is a proof of concept to demonstrate the potential that the Ethereum blockchain has to solve the challenges of identifying counterfeit wine bottles and being able to ensure the authenticity of a given wine bottle. The WineChain token is implemented as an ERC721(Ethereum Request for Comment) non-fungible token. We created a React application integrated with web3 for an easy interface and simplifying interactions with the smart contract. Both of these methods allow a low barrier to entry for virtually anyone to ensure the authenticity of a registered bottle on the chain.

### Built With
